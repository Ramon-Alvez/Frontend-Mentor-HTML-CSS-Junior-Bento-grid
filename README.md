## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned 📚

I learned that I still have a lot to learn 😅. Jokes aside, this was one of the hardest I've ever done, but I'm glad I made it to the end!

### Continued development 🚀

My current goal is to finish all the FrontEnd Mentor challenges, to train and learn in the process. After finishing all HTML and CSS challenges, I will start JavaScript lessons.
